# Basic Colang file for input/output rails

# --- Input Rails ---

# Define forbidden topics or words
define flow self check input
  # Example: Block discussion about "politics"
  if $user_message =~ "politics"
    bot respond "I prefer not to discuss political topics."
    stop

  # Example: Block harmful language patterns (simple example)
  if $user_message =~ "hate speech pattern" # Replace with actual patterns/checks
     bot respond "Please use respectful language."
     stop

  # If input is okay, continue to the main LLM
  else
    # This implicitly allows the input to proceed
    pass

# --- Output Rails ---

# Define checks for the LLM's generated response
define flow self check output
  # Example: Ensure politeness (simple check)
  if $last_bot_message !~ /please|thank you|helpful|assist|can I help/ and $last_bot_message !~ /I cannot|I prefer not to/
    # This is a very basic example; real politeness checks are more complex
    # You might use another LLM call here for evaluation if needed.
    # For simplicity, we'll just let it pass here, but you could re-prompt or modify.
    pass # Or potentially: bot respond "Please remember to be polite." stop

  # Example: Block specific unwanted phrases in output
  if $last_bot_message =~ "undesired output phrase"
    bot respond "I seem to have generated something inappropriate. Let me try again or rephrase."
    stop # Prevents the original bad output from reaching the user

  # If output is okay
  else
    pass # Allow the LLM's output
